## Introduction

I conducted this project as part of my portfolio to analyze the iOS App Store dataset and gain insights into app categories, user ratings, pricing strategies, developer trends, and more. The dataset includes key information such as app names, sizes, prices, user ratings, genres, and version details.

## Database Setup

To begin my analysis, I created a MySQL database named `app_store` and loaded the iOS App Store dataset into the `AppData` table. This table contains various fields representing app attributes, such as ID, track name, size, currency, price, ratings, version, genre, and more.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

I explored the dataset by performing various analyses, including:

- The number of apps per genre.
- Overview of app ratings by genre.
- Comparison of average ratings between free and paid apps.
- Genres with low ratings.
- Top-rated apps for each genre.

## Market Insights

Market insights include:

- Most popular app categories based on the number of apps.
- Revenue market share by genre and currency.
- Price distribution within different genres.

## Developer Trends

I analyzed trends and mistakes made by developers, including:

- Common mistakes impacting user ratings.
- User ratings by app version.

## App Ratings and Reviews

I examined the relationship between app size, user ratings, and supported languages:

- User rating distribution by app size category.
- Average user rating based on the number of supported languages.
