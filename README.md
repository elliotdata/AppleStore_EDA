We explore the dataset by performing various analyses, including:

- The number of apps per genre.
- Overview of app ratings by genre.
- Comparison of average ratings between free and paid apps.
- Genres with low ratings.
- Top-rated apps for each genre.

## Market Insights

Market insights include:

- Most popular app categories based on the number of apps.
- Revenue market share by genre and currency.
- Price distribution within different genres.

## Developer Trends

We analyze trends and mistakes made by developers, including:

- Common mistakes impacting user ratings.
- User ratings by app version.

## App Ratings and Reviews

We examine the relationship between app size, user ratings, and supported languages:

- User rating distribution by app size category.
- Average user rating based on the number of supported languages.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into various aspects of the iOS App Store dataset, helping us understand trends, user preferences, monetization strategies, and developer practices.
